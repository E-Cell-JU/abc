title:  "Accommodation Survey by ABC Division"
---

The following report contains a detailed analysis of the living conditions
of the students of Jadavpur University Main Campus. 

The main motive of this survey was to learn about the accommodation
or living condition of the students of Jadavpur University Main
Campus. The goal of the report was to study the various patterns and
trends in student accommodations, it variation with cost , demography,
living conditions, food availability and study hours put in by the students.
We also intended to find out, through this report , the number of mess
around Jadavpur that will be vacated this year. Finally, with this
data we intended to make a report on the pattern of increase or
decrease in the demand of hostel accommodations ,the number of
students not getting hostel accommodation every year, the huge cost of
living and poor food quality in messes and present it to FETSU. The
latter is just a suggestion , as it is one of the ways our report can be put
to use.
